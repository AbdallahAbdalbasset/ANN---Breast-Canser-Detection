# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a **machine learning model** to detect breast cancer based on patient attributes using an **artificial neural network (ANN)**. The model is trained on real-world datasets to provide reliable predictions, aiding in early diagnosis.

## Features
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** Designed and trained to classify breast cancer cases.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assessed model accuracy using key performance metrics.
- **Real-World Dataset:** Utilized publicly available breast cancer datasets from **Kaggle**.
- **Python-Based Implementation:** Built using powerful machine learning libraries.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for data processing and model training.
- **Kaggle** for dataset acquisition.
- **Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras** for building and evaluating the ANN.
